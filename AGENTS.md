# FeatherMark for Apple platforms: agent rules

Rules for AI agents in this repo (`feathermark-apple`, folder `apple/`: the Mac app, the iPhone and iPad app from Phase 12, and the Swift packages both use). `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. The shared rules for all FeatherMark repos are in `../AGENTS.md`; global rules in `~/Dropbox/Configs/claude/AGENTS.md` still apply.

## Build and test (before saying a change works)

Everything, macOS and iOS (the shared packages, the Mac app, the iPhone and iPad app, and iOS 18 when that runtime is installed), stopping at the first failure (the local stand-in for "CI green"; prints `all tests: OK`):

```bash
bash scripts/test_all.sh
```

The Mac app alone, from this repo's root (the `.xcodeproj` is generated, never committed):

```bash
xcodegen generate && xcodebuild test -project FeatherNote.xcodeproj -scheme FeatherNote -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

The iPhone and iPad app alone (unit and UI tests; run it on an iPad too, e.g. `name=iPad Pro 11-inch (M5)`):

```bash
xcodegen generate && xcodebuild test -project FeatherNote.xcodeproj -scheme FeatherMarkiOS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'
```

Release build and universal check:

```bash
xcodebuild build -project FeatherNote.xcodeproj -scheme FeatherNote -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build -quiet && lipo -archs "build/Build/Products/Release/FeatherMark.app/Contents/MacOS/FeatherMark"
```

A single package: `swift test --package-path Packages/<Name>`.

The shared packages on an iOS simulator (the first available iPhone, or `FEATHER_IOS_DESTINATION`; stops at the first failure). Install a simulator runtime first if `xcrun simctl list runtimes` is empty: `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS`.

```bash
bash scripts/test_ios_packages.sh
```

One package on iOS, from its folder (a package with two products, like FeatherCore, uses the `<Name>-Package` scheme):

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme <Name> -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' -quiet
```

On the simulator, Keychain tests skip with `errSecMissingEntitlement` (package tests have no entitlements), and the macOS performance gates and macOS-only tests (`Process`, the local server) are skipped or not compiled.

FeatherCore's performance gate (search and listing 10k notes under 50 ms) is the release build; debug runs only catch large regressions:

```bash
swift test -c release --package-path Packages/FeatherCore --filter PerformanceTests
```

`fncore` is a command-line harness for FeatherCore (`init`, `add`, `list`, `search`, `export`, `import`; run it with no arguments for usage). The crash tests run it and kill it mid-commit.

```bash
swift run --package-path Packages/FeatherCore fncore list <library-dir>
```

## Code layout (when adding code, or deciding where it goes)

| Package | Platforms | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `FeatherCore` | macOS, iOS | The library: SQLite, FTS5, notebooks, tags, Trash, attachments, change log, export, inbox. `fncore` (macOS). |
| `FeatherCrypto` | macOS, iOS | Keys, envelopes, Argon2id, the Keychain stores. |
| `FeatherSync` | macOS, iOS | Codec, API client, account service, sync engine. |
| `FeatherEditor` | macOS, iOS | `FeatherEditorCore` (both): parser, styler, theme, commands, block menu state, the TextKit 2 layout fragment, `Platform.swift`. `FeatherEditor` (macOS): the AppKit `EditorTextView`, block menu panel, image cache; it re-exports the core. |
| `FeatherImport` | macOS | Evernote and Notion importers (import is Mac-only). |
| `FeatherAppModel` | macOS, iOS | `AppModel`, `CloudModel`, account flows, dialogs, formatting, `Shortcut`, `AppPlatform`. |

- Apps: the Mac app is the `FeatherNote` target in `FeatherNote/` (with `ShareExtension/`); the iPhone and iPad app is the `FeatherMarkiOS` target in `iOSApp/` (tests in `iOSAppTests/` and `Tests/iOSUI/`). Both come from the one `project.yml`.
- Behaviour goes in FeatherAppModel; views only read the model and call it. Platform abilities come in through `AppPlatform` (`FeatherNote/App/MacPlatform.swift` on the Mac, `iOSApp/App/IOSPlatform.swift` on iPhone and iPad; `.none` in tests). Mac-only behaviour that needs AppKit stays in the app as an `extension AppModel` (Share hand-off, import).
- Editor logic goes in FeatherEditorCore. Never name `NS*` or `UI*` UI types there (`NSFont`, `NSColor`, `NSImage`, `NSBezierPath`…); use `Platform*` and the helpers in `Platform.swift`, which call exactly the AppKit API on macOS.
- Each shared package is tested on both platforms (`scripts/test_ios_packages.sh` for iOS). Timing tests and the performance gates run on macOS; on the simulator they show as skipped.

## Dropbox (after cloning, after a build, and after git work)

```bash
for d in .git/index build Packages/*/.build; do [ -e "$d" ] && xattr -w com.dropbox.ignored 1 "$d"; done
```

## Specs and plans (when starting or finishing a phase)

Specs, crypto test vectors, designs and the roadmap live in the `universal` repo at `../universal/`. Phase workflow: `../universal/AGENTS.md`. From Phase 6, FeatherCrypto's tests read `../universal/test-vectors/`; CI then checks out the universal repo next to this one. That repo is private, so the checkout needs a read-only deploy key or fine-grained token stored as a secret in this repo.

## Decisions (when naming, versioning or signing anything)

| Decision | Value |
|---|---|
| Bundle id prefix | `app.feathermark` (app: `app.feathermark.FeatherMark`; switched from `app.feathernote` on 2026-11-10, before any release; registered in the developer account with the App Group `group.app.feathermark`) |
| App product name | `FeatherMark` (renamed from Feather Note, 2026-11-10; identifiers keep the old name only where users never see them: the Mac app's `FeatherNote` module, scheme and folder. The bundle id, Keychain services and URL scheme carry the new name; `LibraryLocation` moves an old `Application Support/Feather Note` library once) |
| Version | `MARKETING_VERSION` / `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.yml` |
| Minimum OS | macOS 15; Release builds are universal (arm64 + x86_64) |
| iPhone and iPad | iOS and iPadOS 18, one universal app (Phase 12), the same bundle id as the Mac (`app.feathermark.FeatherMark`) for a later universal purchase. Target and scheme `FeatherMarkiOS` (module `FeatherMarkiOS`, product `FeatherMark`); device builds sign with team `T6ASVW97L9` |
| Swift tests | Swift Testing (`import Testing`); XCTest only for UI tests |
| Signing | Ad hoc locally, `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` in CI; Developer ID in Phase 10 |
| Swift packages | One per module under `Packages/`; product, target and `<Name>Tests` names are fixed because `project.yml` refers to them |
| License | MIT, copyright `The FeatherMark authors` |

## The app (when changing anything under FeatherNote/)

- `AppModel` (`Packages/FeatherAppModel`) owns every behaviour and all UI state; views only read it and call its methods. Test behaviour through `AppModel` in `FeatherAppModelTests` (runs on macOS and iOS), not through views; Mac-only behaviour (hot keys, capture, import, views) is tested in `FeatherNoteTests` (hosted by the app), whose `makeModel` opens the model with `MacPlatform.make()`.
- The main window is an AppKit `NSWindow` hosting SwiftUI, created in `AppDelegate`. SwiftUI's `Window`/`WindowGroup` scene opened no window unless the app was launched through LaunchServices, so XCUITest and shell launches showed nothing.
- The text views (FeatherEditor's `EditorTextView`, `TitleEditor`) must keep every macOS substitution off (`applyNoSubstitutions()` / `disableSubstitutions()`); `editorTextViewHasNoSubstitutions` guards it.
- Never let SwiftUI measure a view with `.fixedSize(vertical:)` or an unbounded height: during min-size probing at near-zero widths it reports a huge height and the whole window content shifts upward.
- Launch arguments for tests only: `-FeatherLibraryPath <dir>` (never touch the real library) and `-FeatherColorScheme light|dark`. A unit-test host run always uses a temporary library.
- `-FeatherImportFixture <path>` (UI tests only) starts an import of that `.enex`, `.zip` or folder at launch.
- UI tests drive the screen. The first run may ask once to let Xcode control the computer. Screenshots of the designed screens, compared with `../universal/design/handoff/screens/`:

```bash
TEST_RUNNER_FEATHER_SHOT_LIB=<seeded library dir> xcodebuild test -project FeatherNote.xcodeproj -scheme FeatherNote -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:FeatherNoteUITests/ScreenshotTests
```

  Images land in `~/Library/Containers/app.feathermark.FeatherNoteUITests.xctrunner/Data/tmp/shots/`. Seed a library with `fncore init` and `fncore import <dir> <markdown folder>`. Don't use `screencapture`: it asks the user for screen-recording permission.

## The iPhone and iPad app (when changing anything under iOSApp/)

- Views only: behaviour goes in FeatherAppModel (Phase 12 added `trashWithUndo`, `searchAll`, `filterChips`, `NoteThumbnail`, `Formatting.exportSummary`). `AppBootstrap.makeModel` opens the model the way the app does; the app shows `RootView`, a `NavigationSplitView` (library, note list, reader) that is a stack on iPhone.
- No network yet: nothing calls `cloud.restoreAtLaunch()` until sync (Phase 15). `appMakesNoRequestAtLaunch` guards it.
- The library is `Application Support/FeatherMark`, created with file protection `completeUntilFirstUserAuthentication` (`LibraryLocation.prepare`). The simulator reports no protection class, so that test records a known issue there; check it on a device.
- Launch arguments for tests only: `-FeatherTemporaryLibrary` (a fresh library in the app's own tmp), `-FeatherLibraryPath <dir>`, `-FeatherSeedDemo` (debug builds, isolated runs only: the notes the mobile boards show, `DemoLibrary`), `-FeatherColorScheme light|dark`. Isolated runs use the `app.feathermark.FeatherMark.isolated` defaults suite, which persists between runs on one simulator: tests must not depend on its values.
- The reader is a read-only TextKit 2 `UITextView` built by hand (`NSTextContentStorage` + `NSTextLayoutManager`), fed by `MarkdownStyler.styledText` (whole note, no caret, every marker hidden) and drawn with `DecoratedLayoutFragment`. Never touch its `layoutManager`. Links, checkboxes and attachments aren't tappable until the editor (Phase 13).
- iPad: the three columns sit side by side in landscape; in portrait the system hides the library behind the sidebar button. On iOS 27 the library floats over the list column, so a right swipe on a row reveals Pin but can't travel far enough for a full swipe.
- Searching from the library shows results in the library column (as Notes does); iOS 27 puts that field at the bottom. The list's own field searches within the open view, scoped as on the Mac.
- Export goes through the Files picker (`.fileMover`); each export's folder is "FeatherMark Export <date> <time>", because the picker can't merge into a folder that's already there.
- UI tests: iPad runs in landscape (`FeatherUITestCase.setUp`). On iOS 27 a list row's label is on its button, not its cell (`row(_:)` matches either), and `swipeLeft()` isn't a full swipe (`fullSwipe`). xcodebuild can hang after a failing UI test: `scripts/test_all.sh` stops it after 5 silent minutes.
- Screenshots of the designed screens (`ios-<screen>-<iphone|ipad>-<light|dark>.png`), compared with `../universal/design/handoff/screens/mobile-*-ios-*`:

```bash
TEST_RUNNER_FEATHER_SHOT_DIR=<dir> xcodebuild test -project FeatherNote.xcodeproj -scheme FeatherMarkiOS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' -only-testing:FeatherMarkiOSUITests/ScreenshotUITests
```

- iOS 18 (the minimum): Xcode 27 can't download an iOS 18 simulator runtime (`xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS -buildVersion 18.x` says it isn't available). Download the iOS 18 Simulator Runtime from developer.apple.com and add it with `xcrun simctl runtime add <dmg>`; `scripts/test_all.sh` then runs the packages and the app on it (`scripts/ios18_destination.sh`).

## FeatherEditor (when changing the editor package)

- The text storage always holds the note's exact Markdown; nothing is ever inserted or removed for display. Styling is attributes (`MarkdownStyler`, a pure function from text + parse to runs) plus TextKit 2 layout fragments (`DecoratedLayoutFragment`) that draw bullets, checkboxes, quote and code surfaces, rules, images and chips. Hidden markers are real characters at font size 0.01.
- TextKit 2 only: never touch `layoutManager` (it switches the view to TextKit 1 for good). Use `textLayoutManager`.
- TextKit reads paragraph attributes (paragraph style, `.featherDecoration`) from a paragraph's first character, so style from the line start (`eachLine`, `fullLines`), not from the block's range.
- A fragment's frame already starts at the paragraph's indent: place decorations relative to `textStartX`, never by adding the indent again. `locationForCharacter(at:)` is unreliable for the character right after a kerned glyph.
- Styling work must stay proportional to the edit: a keystroke restyles its block once, a caret move restyles the blocks it left and entered, and a full restyle styles 16 KB around the caret and the rest in background chunks. `RestyleScopeTests` and `BackgroundStylingTests` guard this.
- Pathological input: nesting past 32 levels is neutralised before parsing (`NestingLimit`), and a block over 64 KB is shown as plain Markdown (`maxStyledBlockLength`).
- `IncrementalParser` must always equal a full parse (`matchesFullParseAfterRandomEdits`). It reparses to the end of the note for fences, HTML block openers and closers, and unclosed fences or HTML blocks before the edit; any `]:` in the note (a possible link reference definition) makes it parse in full.
- Markers reveal only at the selection's two ends (the caret), so ⌘A restyles two blocks, not the note.
- Work that finishes after an await (attachment import) must check `loadGeneration` and use an anchor moved by edits, never a range captured before the await.
- Performance gate (release; debug only catches large regressions): `swift test -c release --package-path Packages/FeatherEditor --filter PerformanceTests`. Budgets (the benchmark warms AppKit up first, as the app does at launch): open a 50k-word note < 150 ms, keystroke median < 4 ms and p99 < 16 ms, hostile inputs < 1 s. `timeout`/`alarm` around `swift test` leaves `swiftpm-testing-helper` running: `pkill -f swiftpm-testing-helper` afterwards.
- Screenshots of the editor without UI automation: `FEATHER_SHOT_DIR=<dir> swift test --package-path Packages/FeatherEditor --filter RenderShotsTests`, then compare with `../universal/design/handoff/screens/desktop-editor-*`.
- Block menu ("+" in the margin, "/" at a line start): every choice is a pure `EditorCommands.block` edit that replaces the caret's line, so the pick and its "/query" are one undo step. "/" opens only where `slashOpensMenu` says (the line's text begins, outside code and source blocks), in live mode. Image or file and scan go through `importAndInsert` with an anchor taken at the pick. The panel never takes focus when opened by "/"; the editor forwards arrows, Return and Esc (`doCommand(by:)`).
- To add a corpus file: drop a `.md` file into `Packages/FeatherEditor/Tests/FeatherEditorTestSupport/Fixtures/corpus/`. Every corpus test (round trip, incremental-vs-full parse, nesting limit untouched), on macOS and iOS, picks it up.

## Capture (when changing quick note, Services, the Share extension or scans)

- Everything captured from outside the editor is an `InboxItem` (FeatherCore `Inbox.swift`) in `<library>/Inbox/<id>/`. The item id becomes the note id, so capturing twice makes one note, and a folder is removed only after its note commits. `CaptureText.split`: first line (≤ 100 characters) is the title, and nothing is dropped.
- The Share extension is sandboxed and ad-hoc signed, so it can't share an App Group container without a prompt. Each capture goes on its own pasteboard, `app.feathermark.inbox.<id>`, and the extension opens `feathermark://inbox?id=<id>`; the app collects it (`InboxHandOff`, compiled into both targets). Switch to an App Group container with Developer ID (Phase 10).
- The global shortcut uses Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` with `kEventHotKeyExclusive`. A clash with another app's ordinary registration can't be detected; Settings reports macOS's own shortcuts (`HotKey.systemShortcuts()`) and says so.
- Isolated runs (a test host, or any launch with `-FeatherLibraryPath`) use the `app.feathermark.FeatherMark.isolated` defaults suite, register no global shortcut and ignore `feathermark://` URLs, so tests never touch the real settings or a real capture.
- Continuity Camera: `EditorTextView.validRequestor` accepts images and PDF; the Note menu gets an `NSMenuItem.importFromDeviceIdentifier` item, re-added whenever the menu bar opens (SwiftUI rebuilds its menus). Image data wins over a PDF flavour when both are offered.

## FeatherSync and Feather Cloud (when changing sync, accounts or the Cloud screens)

- The free app makes no network request until the user starts the trial, signs in or connects a server, or a sign-in is stored from an earlier launch. `CloudModel` builds no `APIClient` or `URLSession` before that; `freeAppMakesNoRequests` guards it.
- Local edits reach sync only through FeatherCore's change log: `collectChanges()` turns rows into dirty `sync_items`. Remote changes are written with `Library.applyRemote*`, which never log, and which refuse (return false) when the item changed here since the engine looked; the engine then resolves again. Never write a remote change any other way.
- `markPushed(…, ifDirtySeq:)` clears dirty state only if nothing changed after the snapshot. Push conflicts are left dirty and resolved during the pull, in seq order.
- Conflict copies follow sync-protocol.md "Conflict resolution"; resolution always downloads the server's body (`forceBlob`), never trusts this Mac's `blob_sha`.
- Feather Cloud's address and billing come from the app's Info.plist (`project.yml`: `FeatherCloudURL`, `FeatherCloudBilling`), so the signed-out app knows them without a request. 1.0.0 ships billing off: no trial, subscribe or plan screens on Feather Cloud (`CloudModel.billingEnabled`; once signed in, the account's `billing_enabled` decides). Replace `CLOUD_DOMAIN` when the domain is bought. A missing or invalid `FeatherCloudURL` (or plain http) falls back to `https://feather-cloud.invalid`, a host that never resolves, never to a real domain.
- Secrets: the session token is in the Keychain service `app.feathermark.FeatherMark.session`, the master key in `app.feathermark.FeatherMark.master-key`, both keyed `"<server host>|<email>"`. Isolated runs and tests use in-memory stores (`CloudEnvironment.memory`, the default of `AppModel.open`).
- Unit tests: `swift test --package-path Packages/FeatherSync --filter FeatherSyncTests`. Two-device tests against the local server (the target is not in the app's scheme):

```bash
(cd ../server && FEATHER_TRUST_PROXY=true FEATHER_BILLING=on docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --build --wait)
```

```bash
FEATHER_SYNC_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:8420 swift test --package-path Packages/FeatherSync --filter FeatherSyncIntegrationTests
```

  They read verification codes from the server's log and give each account its own `X-Forwarded-For`. Prelogin, login and recover share 10 calls a minute per email.
- Screens: render them with `TEST_RUNNER_FEATHER_SHOT_DIR=<dir> xcodebuild test … -only-testing:FeatherNoteTests/CloudScreensRender` and compare with `../universal/design/handoff/screens/desktop-onboarding-*`, `desktop-signin-*`, `desktop-settings-*`, `desktop-sync-status-*`. Copy comes from `../universal/design/ui-copy.md` word for word.

## FeatherImport (when changing an importer)

- Every importer returns an `ImportBundle` (FeatherCore): notebooks, notes with `feather-import://<token>` attachment links, and a scratch folder of attachment files. `Library.importBundle` writes it in one transaction; cancelling the task or any error imports nothing, and the scratch folder is always removed.
- The mapping rules are `../universal/specs/import-formats.md`. Change the spec first, then the code, so other platforms import the same way.
- `ENEXReader`: `ResourceExtractor` decodes every `<data>` (outside CDATA) to a file in a byte-level pre-pass, with an `autoreleasepool` per chunk, and `XMLParser` reads a small skeleton. ENML is converted after the ENEX parse, because `NSXMLParser` can't run inside another parser's callback.
- `NotionReader` unzips with `/usr/bin/ditto` (multi-part exports included). Tests build Notion-style exports at runtime (`NotionFixture`), not committed folders.
- Real exports hold personal data: keep them out of every repo. Run them with `FEATHER_REAL_EXPORTS=<folder> swift test --package-path Packages/FeatherImport --filter realExportsImportCompletely` (prints counts only).
- Performance gate (release): `swift test -c release --package-path Packages/FeatherImport --filter ImportPerformanceTests`, 5,000 notes and 500 images under 15 s.
- To add an ENEX fixture: put it in `Packages/FeatherImport/Tests/FeatherImportTests/Fixtures/enex/`; generate base64 and MD5 with a script, never by hand.

## FeatherCrypto (when changing crypto)

- `../universal/specs/crypto.md` is normative. A change to an algorithm, parameter, label or byte layout goes there first, with regenerated test vectors and a bumped version marker.
- The tests read `../universal/test-vectors/` (or the folder in `FEATHER_TEST_VECTORS`) and fail when it's missing; never copy vector values into code.
- `Sodium.swift` is the only file that calls libsodium (swift-sodium's `Clibsodium`, pinned to 0.9.1). Functions that use randomness have an internal overload taking the nonce or salt, for the vectors.
- Data from a server, a file or the user fails with one of `CryptoError`'s three kinds; a caller's bad argument throws `InvalidArgument` before any crypto runs. Only the v1 Argon2id parameters are accepted.
- The master key is stored by `KeychainMasterKeyStore`, this device only. iOS has only the data protection keychain; macOS still uses the file-based one, because an ad-hoc-signed process gets `errSecMissingEntitlement` (-34018) there: switch with Developer ID (Phase 10). Tests use their own service name or `InMemoryMasterKeyStore`; the Keychain round trips run only where `KeychainProbe.available` (skipped on the iOS simulator, never silently passed).

## FeatherCore (when changing the library code)

- Every mutation goes through `Library.write`, which wraps it in one transaction together with its change-log rows. A `write` inside another `write` joins the outer transaction (import relies on this). Never write to the database outside `write`.
- FTS5 stays in sync through triggers on `notes`. Change the triggers in a new migration, never in migration 0.
- Schema changes are new entries appended to `Schema.migrations`; never edit a shipped one.

## Gotchas

- Git replaces `.git/index` with a new file on commit, reset and similar commands, and the new file has no `com.dropbox.ignored` flag. Re-run the Dropbox command above after git work.
